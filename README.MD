# C# support for Gauge

 [ ![Download Nightly](https://api.bintray.com/packages/gauge/gauge-csharp/Nightly/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/gauge/gauge-csharp/Nightly/_latestVersion)

This project adds C# support for [Gauge](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge) testing. Read more about Gauge [here](http://getgauge.io/documentation/user/current/index.html).

You can download Gauge [here](http://getgauge.io)

This repository hosts three projects, `Core`, `Lib` and `Runner`.

## Gauge Core

### *Internal Gauge Use Only*
`Core` is a dll that brings in Gauge's API and connection to C#, and also holds the protobuf communication code. It is hosted in [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Gauge.CSharp.Core/), and is not listed in the search results. This package is used by `Lib` and `Runner` only.

Read more about `Core` [here](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge-csharp/tree/master/Core).

## Gauge Lib
`Lib` is a dll that brings in Gauge's data types to C#. It is hosted in [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Gauge.CSharp.Lib/).

Read more about `Lib` [here](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge-csharp/tree/master/Lib).

## Gauge CSharp Runner
`Runner` is an executable that is invoked by Gauge Core. The `Runner` acts a bridge between C# test code and Gauge's API.

Read more about `Runner` [here](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge-csharp/tree/master/Runner).

## Gauge-Proto
This is a submodule of the repository `https://github.com/getgauge/gauge-proto`. This repository holds the `.proto` files that act as contracts between Gauge and the plugins. This submodule needs to be fetched to generate the protobuf classes.

## Developer notes

### Install

#### Runner
Installing the runner is done via Gauge Core. This means that you need Gauge installed as a pre-requisite. You can download Gauge [here](http://getgauge.io/download.html).

Once you have Gauge installed, add the csharp plugin using:

    gauge --install csharp

#### Lib
The Lib is a reference that you can add to your test project, as you would do with any Nuget package.

You will need Gauge and Gauge-csharp plugin installed before installing `Lib`.

### Build

On mono:
```
./build.sh CopyBinaries
```

On Windows
```
build.cmd CopyBinaries
```

### Test

On mono:
```
./build.sh RunTests
```

On Windows
```
build.cmd RunTests
```

### Package

On mono:
```
./build.sh Package
```

On Windows
```
build.cmd Package
```

All artifacts are genereated in `.\artifacts` folder.

 * The plugin is zipped to `artifacts/gauge-csharp/gauge-csharp-<runner-version>.zip`,
 where `<runner-version>` is from top of `CHANGELOG.md` file.
 * The Lib Nuget package is put at `artifacts/gauge-csharp-lib/Gauge.CSharp.Lib.<lib-version>.nupkg`,
 where `<lib-version>` is from top of `Lib/CHANGELOG.md` file.
 * The Core Nuget package is put at `artifacts/gauge-csharp-core/Gauge.CSharp.Core.<core-version>.nupkg`,
 where `<core-version>` is from top of `Core/CHANGELOG.md` file.

#### Zip

Zip distribution in `artifacts/gauge-csharp/gauge-csharp-<runner-version>.zip` can be created with
On mono:
```
./build.sh Zip
```

On Windows
```
build.cmd Zip
```

### Install the plugin

To install a local version of the plugin:

    run.bat install

### Regenerate the API messages (protocol buffer api changes)

Update the submodule and run the `gen-proto` command:

    git submodule update
    run.bat gen-proto

## Development Environment Setup

### Windows

- Use [BoxStarter](http://boxstarter.org/) to setup Windows box.
  - Install Windows
  - Hit http://bit.ly/20pMrXY from Internet Explorer/Edge.
  - Install Visual Studio and Resharper separately (You could consider installing from an ISO).

### Linux

For building and unit testing you only need mono.
For running functional tests *TODO what else?*
 * gauge
 * java (which one?)
